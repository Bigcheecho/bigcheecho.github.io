# Jared's Page
Welcome to my page! I'm a programmer mostly looking to create video games. I've created this page mostly to show off projects I've previously worked on and am currently working on.

This is a WIP 2D beat-em'-up platformer game I'm creating in Godot. All code, which is written in GDscript, as well as most art assets other than the character art were created by me. The character art was done by Misha Desear, while sounds were Creative Commons sounds found online (attributions below).

This was a 3D maze game I worked on with a group of 4 on Unity 3D for Global Game Jam 2021. I was the primary programmer for this project, creating character movement, the camera script, and an enemy that chases the player.

<h3>Bleeding Steam</h3>

This was a 2D game I created in Unity for Global Game Jam 2020. Music was created by Gunnar Clovis, while the rest of the game - code, art, and all - was created by myself.

NSFW Unity project I've worked on is also available upon request.
